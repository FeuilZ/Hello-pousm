# **Greetings universe!**

**Nice to meet you, and welcome to my information page.**

My name is Bastien Clémot, a 23-year-old French arthropod enthusiast and **PhD Student**. I am currently conducting research in behavioural neuroscience at Lund University as part of my doctoral thesis.

Driven by a passion for arthropodology, my research focuses on the neural and behavioural mechanisms that allow dung beetles to orient in straight lines using environmental cues, a crucial strategy to minimize competition around resources. My project focuses on how these insects integrate and prioritize various sensory cues (_e.g._, sun position, polarized light, wind direction) within the central complex and how this integration influences their orientation. Through both lab and field experiments, I analyze how these signals are processed despite sensory noise, aiming to model their visual field and create biomimetic models.

Previously, I pursued a **Bachelor’s degree in Biology & Ecology**, which gave me a strong foundation in ecological theories, naturalism, and fieldwork. This program also provided insights into various scientific fields, such as geology, biochemistry, and microbiology. During this degree, I completed three internships in research laboratories, focusing on plant biology, plant pathology, and plant-mosquito interactions.

I made my **first Master’s year in Functional, Behavioural & Evolutionary Ecology**, which expanded my knowledge and research skills. During this time, I conducted a three-month internship in New Zealand, where I studied the courtship behaviour of an endemic species of fishing spiders. Following that, I completed a **second Master’s year in Ecology Modelling**, further developing my expertise in statistical analysis, modelling, and programming tools.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have developed strong skills in behavioural ecology, ecological modelling, and scientific communication. I am proficient in statistical analysis, R and Python programming, QGis, and version control with Git. My role as president of the Nantes Student Naturalists' Circle also strengthened my naturalist knowledge and my commitment to science communication.

**Thank you for visiting this repo, and have a great time in this universe.**
