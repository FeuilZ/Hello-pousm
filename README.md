# **Greetings universe!**

### Nice to meet you, and welcome to my **information page**.

My name is Bastien Cl√©mot, a 22-years-old french student and spider-enthusiast. I'm currently doing my 2nd master year in **modelling** & **ecology**.

I started my scientific cursus with a **Bacchelor's degre** in **Biology & Ecology**, which gave me strong baggages in main ecological theories, naturalism and fieldwork. This education program also gave me insights into various scientific fields, such as geology, biochemistry, microbiology, and others.

During this degree, I completed three internships in research laboratories, two in plant biology and pathology, and one focusing on plant-mosquito interactions. But you'll find more about them on my LinkedIn webpage (see my GitHub profile).

I then pursued a **Master's degree** in **Functional, Behavioural & Evolutionary Ecology**, which expanded my knowledge and research skills.

During this year, I conducted a three-month internship in New Zealand, where I studied the courtship behaviour of an endemic species of fishing spider. But once again, details can be found on my LinkedIn webpage. 

Currently, I'm completing my second Master's year in **Ecology Modelling**, with the aim to enhance my skills in statistical analysis, modelling, and various programming tools and languages. Therefore, I'm using this GitHub page to showcase my work and ongoing learning.

Thanks for visiting this repo, and have a great time in this universe.

#### *PS: Oh. did I mention I absolutely love spiders and that studying them is my main passion and goal in my professional career? I think I should.*
